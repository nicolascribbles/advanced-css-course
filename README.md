 ## Udemy Advanced CSS Course

# Natours

## Section 1 (Part One)
- In section 1, I added the github repository and configured my files to the Vagrant Box

## Section 2
- In Section 2, I began working on the project with all of the starter files (1 hr 45 minutes)
    - Created Section Intro and header
    - Covered reset styles and the order of CSS structure ( it should match the html document order )
    - Covered CSS Animations and creating them from scratch using keyframes
    - Built a complex animated button using pseudo-elements and pseudo-classes

## Section 3
- In section 3, I learned about the BEM method and we talked about how CSS is rendered. Not much changes to the project happened here.

## Section 4
- In section 4, I was introduced to SASS and npm, and we began converting the files.
    - I was able to get this installed on my work and home computer with Git Bash and terminal to command-line my changes into a repository.
    - We covered Variables and Nesting
    - Mixins, Extends, Functions
    - Installing Sass locally and compiling SCSS
    - Sass Architecture was also very important, as it was applied to the rest of the project and helps make CSS easier to write.
    - Bonus: Installed Emmet for my IDE's at work and home.
    
## Section 5 (Part Two)
- In section 5, we built the rest of the page
    - We made background videos for sections
    - Flip cards
    - Figures and figcaptions with cool hover effects
    - Form styling
    - Build Navigation
        * Checkbox Hack, Solid-color gradients, how and when to use transform-origin, which was not used in this project
    - Built Pure CSS popup
        
## Section 6 (Part Three)
- In section 6, we are focusing on media queries and responsive design
    - Use mixins to write media queries
    - Responsive images,
    - @supports tags,
    - and more!
    
    - Section Bonus / Challenge: Popup Responsive Styles - I removed the left side on the pop-up and gave it a set height so the text would overflow and remain responsive on anything smaller than a tablet device.

## Section 7 - Beginning the Trillo Project
- In section 7, we begin looking into flex-box design, custom css properties, masks and SVGs
    - Learned intricacies and simplicities of flexbox layout
        * X axis is called the Main Axis
        * Y axis is called the Cross Axis
        * Container: HOLDS ITEMS. flex-direction, flex-wrap, justify-content, align-content.
        * Items: CAN HOLD MORE CONTAINERS. align-self, order, flex (grow shrink basis).
    - Used flexbox layout to create:
        * A header which contained a logo, a search bar with svg icon, and a user navigation
        * A sidebar with the main navigation of an application
        * A main element where the web app content or views are displayed
    - Used cubic-bezier to create an advanced hover animation over the main nav
    - Implemented an SVG font from icomoon
    - I used NPM libraries to minify the code and to add missing pre-fixes
    - Responsive layout was a breeze with the organizing tools flexbox provides

## Section 8
- In section 8, CSS grid lectures and starting Nexter

## Section 9
- In section 9, I am building Nexter with grid and flex

    

# Course Material and FAQ for my Advanced CSS Course

This repo contains starter files and the finished project files for all the projects contained in the course.

Plus, I made all the [course slides available for download](slides-students-C04.pdf), to make it easier to follow along the conceptual videos.

ðŸ‘‡ **_Please read the following Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) carefully before starting the course_** ðŸ‘‡

## FAQ

### Q1: How do I download the files?

**A:** If you're new to GitHub and just want to download the complete package, hit the green button saying "Clone or download", choose the "Download ZIP" option, and you're good to go.

### Q2: One of the NPM packages is not working (compiling Sass, live-reload, etc). How to fix it?

Unfortunately, this is quite common. I listed some possible fixes [in this document](npm-fixes.md).

### Q3: I'm stuck in one of the projects. Where do I get help?

**A:** Have you extensively tried fixing the problem on your own? If you failed at fixing it, please **post a detailled description of the problem to the Q&A area of that video over at Udemy**, along with a [codepen](https://codepen.io/pen/) containing your code. You will get help as fast as possible! Please don't send me a personal message or email to fix coding problems.

### Q4: You keep mentioning your resources page. Where can I find it?

**A:** It's on my website at <http://codingheroes.io/resources>. You can subscribe for updates ðŸ˜‰

### Q5: What VSCode theme are you using?

**A:** I use Oceanic Next (dimmed bg) for all my coding and course production. [Here is my complete VSCode setup](vscode-setup.md).

### Q6: You use codepens in some of the lectures. Where can I find them?

**A:** They are all available on my [public codepen profile](https://codepen.io/jonasschmedtmann/pens/public/). The ones you're looking for might be buried under some newer ones.

### Q7: Can I see a final version of the course projects?

**A:** Sure, I have an online version of all three. Here they are: [Natours](https://natours.netlify.com) (advanced CSS, Sass and responsive design), [Trillo](http://trillo.netlify.com/) (flexbox) and [Nexter](https://nexter.netlify.com/) (CSS Grid).

### Q8: Videos don't load, can you fix it?

**A:** Unfortunately, there is nothing I can do about it. The course is hosted on Udemy's platform, and sometimes they have small technical issues like this one. Please just come back a bit later or [contact their support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q9: Videos are blurred / have low quality, can you fix it?

**A:** Please open video settings and change the quality from 'Auto' to another value, for example 720p. If that doesn't help, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q10: Are the videos downloadable?

**A:** Yes, I made all videos downloadable on the Udemy platform so you can learn even without an internet connection. To download a video, use the settings icon in the right bottom corner of the video player.

### Q11: I love your courses and want to get updates on new courses. How?

**A:** First, you can subscribe to my email list [at my website](http://codingheroes.io/newsletter). Plus, I make important announcements on twitter [@jonasschmedtman](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman), so you should definitely follow me there ðŸ”¥

### Q12: How do I get my certificate of completion?

**A:** A certificate of completion is provided by Udemy after you complete 100% of the course. After completing the course, just click on the "Your progress" indicator in the top right-hand corner of the course page. If you want to change your name on the certificate, please [contact the Udemy support team](https://support.udemy.com/hc/en-us).

### Q13: Do you accept pull requests?

**A:** No, for the simple reason that I want this repository to contain the _exact_ same code that is shown in the videos. However, please feel free to add an issue if you found one.
